# StochasticProximalOptimization

We analyze stochastic optimization problems for a broad class of objective functions,including convex and continuous submodular functions.
The article explains how to learn a new orthogonal dictionary dynamically from streaming data without storing any historical data using an online orthogonal dictionary. The main
challenge is to solve problem without the accessibility of F(D) or âˆ‡F(D) An efficient online
algorithm with convergence analysis is designed with a novel problem formulation. Two algorithms discussed in this paper are: Stochastic Frank Wolfe (SFW) and NonConvex Frank
Wolfe Method
